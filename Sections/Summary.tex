\section{Summary}
In this assignment the goal was to position a ball at a given point on a beam. This was done by adjusting the angle of the beam and measuring the distance from one end of the beam to the ball. The cad files for the assembly of the model was given to us in advance. The angle of the beam was adjusted by controlling the position of a servo motor connected to the beam via a lever-arm. A PID-regulator was built on an Arduino UNO micro-controller to adjust the servo-position using the measured distance to the ball as the process-value.

Using trial and error we achieved a result that we were somewhat satisfied with. The ball reached the setpoint relatively quick, but because of noise in the sensor input, the regulator was not as smooth nor consistent as we would have wanted.

\section{Summary}
In this assignment we were going to position a ball along a beam by adjusting the angle of the beam and measuring the distance from one end to the ball. The cad files for the assembly of the model was given to us in advance, though we had to modify one of the end-plates to be able to mount the distance sensor. The angle of the beam was adjusted by controlling the position of a servo motor connected to the beam via a lever-arm. A PID-regulator was built on an Arduino micro-controller to adjust the servo-position using the distance to the ball as the process-value.

Using trial and error we got a result that we were somewhat satisfied with. The ball reached the setpoint relatively quick, but because of noise in the sensor input, the regulator was not as smooth nor consistent as we would have wanted.
